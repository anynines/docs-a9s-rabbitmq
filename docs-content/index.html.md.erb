 This documentation describes the a9s RabbitMQ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile. a9s RabbitMQ for PCF
 enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated RabbitMQ servers and clusters. Developers can
 create instances of a RabbitMQ server or cluster using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line
 interface (cf CLI) and bind these instances to an app.
 Depending on your service plan, a service instance may be associated with a single, dedicated VM
 or a set of VMs consisting of multiple VMs containing a RabbitMQ cluster.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

When you run the cf CLI ```create-service a9s-rabbitmq``` command,
PCF creates dedicated VMs for this service instance. This provides
protection from bad neighbors.

RabbitMQ service instance provisioning, including VM orchestration, is entirely automated.
This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded by infrastructure virtualization
mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service
instances allocate infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service
instances are destroyed. Using on-demand, provisioning the number of
service instances is not limited by design.

Distributed across multiple infrastructure availability zones,  clustered data
service plans enable short failover times and are resilient against
failures of individual infrastructure hosts or entire availability zones.

### <a id="features"></a>Current Features

a9s RabbitMQ for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| **OnÂ­-demand service instance provisioning** | a9s RabbitMQ for PCF deploys RabbitMQ instances automatically. Developers can provision a single-VM RabbitMQ server or a multi-VM RabbitMQ replica set using one command. |
| **Service instance isolation** | Each RabbitMQ server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad-neighborhood protection and align with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s RabbitMQ for PCF uses Cloud Foundry [application security groups (ASGs)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) to prevent network connections from unauthorized apps.
| **High availability** | a9s RabbitMQ for PCF ensures high availability using RabbitMQ replication.<br/><br/>The Consul-based internal DNS system provided by a9s Consul DNS for PCF ensures that the bound app always connects to a working node. |
| **Smoke tests** | A post-deployment, smoke-test errand runs basic tests against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly. |
| **Service instance capacity upgrade** | By updating your service plan, you can upgrade the RAM, CPU, and storage capacity for your RabbitMQ instances. |
| **Logging and monitoring** | Each RabbitMQ service instance provides log messages and RabbitMQ-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment updater** | An updater errand updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s RabbitMQ for PCF service instances to their latest version. |
| **Backup Manager** | The Backup Manager does regular backups of your instances, and offers endpoints to backup instantly and restore backups. |
| **Service Guard** | The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br /> When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group. The Service Guard also restarts the application instances bound to the affected service instance. **The instances of one app are restarted one by one to avoid downtime.**|
